# Pull Request: Restructure Project to Monorepo Architecture

## 📋 Summary

Complete project restructuring to separate frontend and backend into a clean monorepo architecture with independent deployment capabilities.

## 🎯 Motivation and Context

### Problems Identified

1. **pages/ folder location issue**
   - `pages/` was located outside `app/` directory
   - Docker `COPY . .` command couldn't include pages folder
   - Streamlit multi-page structure was broken

2. **app/src/ nested structure**
   - Unnecessary nesting with `app/src/` causing complex import paths
   - Import statements: `from src.core.config import settings`
   - Dockerfile CMD: `python src/main.py`

3. **Mixed application structure**
   - FastAPI and Streamlit code scattered in root directory
   - No clear separation of concerns
   - Difficult to maintain and scale

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Project Structure

#### Before
```
secondarymarket/
├── app/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── src/              # ❌ Unnecessary nesting
│       ├── api/
│       ├── core/
│       └── main.py
├── pages/                # ❌ Outside app/ directory
│   ├── login.py
│   └── signup.py
└── finance.py            # ❌ Scattered in root
```

#### After
```

### File Changes

- **28 files changed**: 654 insertions(+), 29 deletions(-)
- **Created**:
  - `backend/` directory (moved from `app/src/`)
  - `frontend/` directory structure
  - `frontend/Dockerfile`
  - `frontend/requirements.txt`
  - `.env.example`
  - `MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md`
- **Modified**:
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Added backend/frontend services
  - `README.md` - Complete rewrite with new structure
  - All frontend Python files - Updated import paths
- **Moved**:
  - `app/src/` → `backend/`
  - `pages/` → `frontend/pages/`
  - `finance.py` → `frontend/finance.py`
  - `header.py` → `frontend/components/header.py`

### Technical Changes

#### 1. Backend (FastAPI)
- Removed `src/` nesting: `app/src/` → `backend/`
- Updated Dockerfile:
  ```dockerfile
  # Before
  CMD ["python", "src/main.py"]

  # After
  CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]
  ```
- Simplified import paths:
  ```python
  # Before
  from src.core.config import settings

  # After
  from core.config import settings
  ```

#### 2. Frontend (Streamlit)
- Created dedicated frontend structure
- Fixed pages/ location for Docker COPY
- Updated import paths:
  ```python
  # Before
  from header import render_header

  # After
  from components.header import render_header
  ```
- Added sys.path manipulation for pages:
  ```python
  sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))
  ```

#### 3. Docker Configuration
- Split requirements into `backend/requirements.txt` and `frontend/requirements.txt`
- Created separate Dockerfiles for backend and frontend
- Updated docker-compose.yml with 5 services:
  - `backend` - FastAPI on port 8000
  - `frontend` - Streamlit on port 8501
  - `timescaledb` - PostgreSQL on port 5433
  - `redis` - Redis on port 6379
  - `pgadmin` - PgAdmin on port 5051

## ✅ Testing

### Docker Build & Run
All services built and started successfully:
```bash
✅ Backend:  http://localhost:8000 (healthy)
✅ Frontend: http://localhost:8501 (running)
✅ Database: localhost:5433 (healthy)
✅ Redis:    localhost:6379 (healthy)
✅ PgAdmin:  http://localhost:5051 (running)
```

### Health Check
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000/health
{"status":"healthy","api":"running","database":"pending","redis":"pending"}
```

### Frontend Verification
- Streamlit app starts successfully
- Multi-page structure works correctly
- All pages accessible via pages/ directory

## 📊 Benefits

### Immediate Benefits
- ✅ Clear separation between frontend and backend
- ✅ Simplified import paths (no more `src.` prefix)
- ✅ Docker COPY works correctly with pages/
- ✅ Independent deployment of services
- ✅ Better code organization and readability

### Long-term Benefits
- 🚀 Easy to scale to microservices architecture
- 🚀 Frontend/Backend can be deployed independently
- 🚀 Team collaboration improved (clear boundaries)
- 🚀 Ready for React/Next.js migration if needed
- 🚀 Easier to maintain and extend

## 🔍 Review Checklist

- [ ] Backend service builds and runs correctly
- [ ] Frontend service builds and runs correctly
- [ ] All import paths updated correctly
- [ ] Docker compose services start successfully
- [ ] Health check endpoints working
- [ ] Streamlit pages accessible
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated (README.md)

## 📚 Documentation

New documentation files added:
- `PROJECT_RESTRUCTURING_ALTERNATIVES.md` - Analysis of 3 restructuring options
- `MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` - Detailed migration report
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- Updated `README.md` - Complete project documentation

## 🔄 Migration Path

The migration was performed in phases:
1. Created backup branch (`backup-before-restructure`)
2. Created working branch (`restructure-monorepo`)
3. Backend: Created `backend/` and moved `app/src/` contents
4. Frontend: Created `frontend/` and moved pages + components
5. Updated Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml
6. Fixed import paths in all Python files
7. Built and tested all services
8. Merged to main with proper documentation

## 🎯 Next Steps

After merging this PR:
1. **Authentication System** (P0 Priority)
   - Implement JWT-based authentication
   - Follow `AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Create database schemas

2. **API Implementation**
   - Implement authentication endpoints
   - Add stock data endpoints
   - Connect frontend to backend

3. **Testing**
   - Write backend unit tests (pytest)
   - Add integration tests
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

## 🐛 Known Issues

None. All services tested and working correctly.

## 💬 Additional Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing data
- No database schema changes in this PR
- Authentication system will be implemented in next PR
- This restructuring sets foundation for future scalability

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This restructuring was carefully planned with analysis of multiple alternatives. The chosen monorepo architecture (Alternative 1) provides the best balance of:
- Immediate problem resolution
- Long-term scalability
- Team collaboration
- Independent deployment
